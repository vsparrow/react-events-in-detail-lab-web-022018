props : go from parent to child
the way data strcutured implies how the component will be strcutured
      //App -> image->content[]//comments here tied to image.
create-react-app nameoffolder, likes rails new\
npm install -g yarn   //yarn wrapper for npm, except it caches unlike npm

index.js    render app, index is mostly for  config
registerserviceworker : for progressive web apps: not for us.
error jsx not defined   you didnt import react into file

assign data from one component to different component
<paintingDetails {...paintingData} <- sprad the data from paintingData to send to paintingDetails

functional component  (different from class component)
  const COmmentList= (props)=>{
    console.log(props)  //not this.props , isnt a class component
    return (
      <div>Comment</div>
    )
  }
export default CommentList
//new file
import CommentList from 'commentlist.js'
render(){return(<CommentList />)}           //how we use commentlist in comment.js

how to initialize class?    call it in a render. there is no "new" like in JS
super()                     inherits from react. calls the constructor that it is inheriting from
                            always have a super in your constructor
setState changes               trigger rerender implcictly
  state = {liked:false}
  this.state.liked = !this.state.liked //doesnt call render
  likePainting = (event)               //calls render!
    =>{this.setState({like: !this.state.liked})} //toggle




////////////////////////////////////////State
State is basically data that is mutated in your component
 while a component can't change its own props, it can change its state.
State is used to handle several things in your component:
 Interactivity (e.g. changing data when a user clicks a button)
 Fetching remote data (remote data is, by definition, not available right away when the component is mounted â€”
  state gives us a way of updating the component once that data arrives)
 Reacting to the passing of time (i.e. setting an interval or timeout)

 State vs Prop
 The best way to figure out if data should go in props or state is to ask ourselves 'Will this data ever change?'.
  If not, it's a prop. If it will, it should go in state!


 follow along by running npm install && npm start in your terminal.

 example:
  A toggle button has an on and off state. Using props for that value wouldn't work, since we can't actually change our props!
  /////// state example:
  // src/components/ToggleButton.js
  import React from 'react';
    class ToggleButton extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.state = { isEnabled: false     }
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <button className="toggle-button">
          I am toggled {this.state.isEnabled ? 'on' : 'off'}
        </button>
      )    }  }
  export default ToggleButton;
  // src/components/Address.js
  import React from 'react';
  class Address extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
      super(props);
      this.state = { fullAddress: `${props.street},${props.city}`}
    }
    render(){
      return(
        <div className="address">
          {/* { this.state.fullAddress}  below is better than this */}
          {this.props.street}, {this.props.city}
        </div>
      );    }  }//class
  export default Address;
  // src/index.js
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import ToggleButton from './components/ToggleButton'
  import Address from './components/Address'
  ReactDOM.render(
    // <div>Components Need To Be Mounted</div>,
    <div>
      <ToggleButton />
      <Address
        street="Santa Monica Blvd."
        city="Santa Monica"
      />
    </div>
    ,
    document.getElementById('root')
  )
///////////////////////////Event System

SyntheticEvent React has its own event system with special event handlers
 The reason for having a specific event system instead of using native events is cross-browser compatibilit
Events : https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#supported-events
event.target            get the target of an event
event.preventDefault()  prevent a default action
Event pooling           whenever an event fires, its event data (an object) is sent to the callback.
                       the event object is in effect being sent back to the pool for use in a later event.
                        means wthat when you inspect the properties become null
persist event pool
                      store the data you need in a variable (e.g. const target = event.target),
                      make the event persistent by calling that method: event.persist().
//////Example: event
class Tickler extends React.Component {
  tickle = () => {    console.log('Tee hee!');  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button>Tickle me!</button>                       //no event
      <button onClick={this.tickle}>Tickle me!</button> //event
    );  }}
